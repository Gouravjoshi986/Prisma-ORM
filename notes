Prisma is an ORM which makes communicating with database easier. 

Simpler syntax (converts objects to SQL queries under the hood)
Abstraction that lets you flip the database you are using
Type safety/Auto completion
Automatic Migrations

In Prisma we define a data model for tabels (Table schema).
## Commands for initializing prisma 
npm install prisma 
npx prisma init

// This Generates a schema.prisma file in which we will write our model and give the connection String via env

model User {
  id         Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  username   String   @unique
  password   String
  firstName  String
  lastName   String
} 

A model is defined with keyword model. a object is passed for schema and its types are mentioned 

# Command for migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name message

# Autogenerated Clients  
Prisma needs to automatically create clients for the node file to use when doing operations on database.( using prisma for querries. we need some code which will convert user.find into sql query )
The User class of user table in user.find is generated by prisma with auto gen. clients

npx prisma generate
